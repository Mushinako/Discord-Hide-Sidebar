# Discord Hide Sidebars

I don't need the side bars all the time, so why not hide it?

**This script starts your Discord in debug mode.**
**This means that your personal information may be visible to other programs on your computer or others on the Internet.**
**Do not use this script unless you know what you're doing!**
**By using this script, you acknowledge this possibility.**
**I will *not* be responsible for any damage caused by this script.**
If you don't know how to mitigate this risk and are not willing to take it, please wait for Discord to implement this functionality.

## Known issues

### The Discord client stutters/feels slower/uses more CPU

This is a side effect of debug mode. I'm not sure if this can be fixed.
